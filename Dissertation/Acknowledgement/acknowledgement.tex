I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Roberto Cipolla, and my advisor, Dr. Joan Lasenby, for their guidance over the past two years, as well as their patience and understanding as I was learning the metaphorical computer vision ropes.
I would also like to acknowledge my colleague and friend Dr. Vijay Badrinarayanan, who was always around to offer advice, suggestions or simply a kind word whenever I was working too hard.
Most importantly, I would like to thank my wonderful family and friends in Saudi, the states and elsewhere who supported me through the most difficult period of my life.
