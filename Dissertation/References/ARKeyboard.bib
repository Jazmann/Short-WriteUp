@article{Fitzgibbon1999,
abstract = {This work presents a new efficient method for fitting ellipses to
scattered data. Previous algorithms either fitted general conics or were
computationally expensive. By minimizing the algebraic distance subject
to the constraint 4ac-b<sup>2</sup>=1, the new method incorporates the
ellipticity constraint into the normalization factor. The proposed
method combines several advantages: It is ellipse-specific, so that even
bad data will always return an ellipse. It can be solved naturally by a
generalized eigensystem. It is extremely robust, efficient, and easy to
implement},

@article{Lee2009,
abstract = {We describe a novel markerless camera tracking approach and user interaction methodology for augmented reality (AR) on unprepared tabletop environments. We propose a real-time system architecture that combines two types of feature tracking. Distinctive image features of the scene are detected and tracked frame-to-frame by computing optical flow. In order to achieve real-time performance, multiple operations are processed in a synchronized multi-threaded manner: capturing a video frame, tracking features using optical flow, detecting distinctive invariant features, and rendering an output frame. We also introduce user interaction methodology for establishing a global coordinate system and for placing virtual objects in the AR environment by tracking a user's outstretched hand and estimating a camera pose relative to it. We evaluate the speed and accuracy of our hybrid feature tracking approach, and demonstrate a proof-of-concept application for enabling AR in unprepared tabletop environments, using bare hands for interaction.},

In particular, the quantitative assessment of skin in terms of hemoglobin and melanin content, as well as in terms of its light scattering properties, is a challenging problem in dermatology. We present here a technique for examining human skin, based on the in vivo measurement of diffuse reflectance spectra in the visible and near-infrared ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum. Spectra were measured by means of a fiber optic probe, and they were analyzed using an analytical model of light diffusion in the skin. The results of the analysis indicate that it is possible to obtain quantitative information about hemoglobin and melanin content, as well as basic information regarding the scattering properties of the skin.},

@article{Stamatas2004,
abstract = {The chromatic characteristics of skin color arise from the interactions of light (primarily absorption and scattering) with the epidermis and the dermis. The primary light absorbers in skin are hemoglobin and melanin. Most of scattering is attributed to collagen fibers and in pigmented skin to melanosomes. Traditionally skin redness is considered to arise due to locally elevated concentrations of hemoglobin, whereas skin pigmentation is attributed to melanin. In this study we attempt to understand better the contributions of these chromophores to the perceived skin color using spectral analysis of skin color reactions induced by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation or pressure. In the first experiment 12 individuals with skin phototypes III-IV were irradiated on the back using a solar simulator with doses ranging from 0.7 to 3 MED. The skin reactions were evaluated on days 1, 7, 14, and 21 after irradiation. Evaluations included diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and clinical assessment of the erythema and the pigment reaction. Apparent concentrations of melanin, oxy-, and deoxy-hemoglobin were calculated from the absorption spectra. In the second experiment the levels of deoxy-hemoglobin of the volar forearm of ten volunteers were selectively altered by either application of a pressure cuff or by topical application of 3\% H(2)O(2). Changes in skin color appearance were documented by photography, colorimetry, and DRS. In the UV exposure experiment all reactions were dose dependent. Oxy-hemoglobin values increased to a maximum on day 1, correlating well with the clinical evaluation of erythema, and then decreased exponentially to base line. Melanin showed a significant increase on day 7 and remained relatively constant for the next 3 weeks, correlating well with the clinical evaluation of pigmentation (tanning). Deoxy-hemoglobin increased slightly on day 1 and remained elevated for the next 2 weeks. Thus, deoxy-hemoglobin correlated moderately with the clinical erythema scoring on day 1 only, while it contributes significantly to what is clinically perceived as skin tanning on days 7 and 14. Application of pressure below the diastolic level increased deoxy-hemoglobin concentration as measured by DRS. This increase corresponded to a decrease of a "pigmentation" parameter (based on the L(*)a(*)b(*) scale) in a similar fashion that has been documented for increases in melanin concentration. Topical H(2)O(2) application reduced deoxy-hemoglobin levels as measured by DRS. This reduction coincided kinetically with a visible skin blanching. Application of pressure or H(2)O(2) did not significantly alter the levels of oxy-hemoglobin or melanin. In this report we present compelling evidence that deoxy-hemoglobin significantly contributes to the skin color appearance. Blood pooling, expressed as increased deoxy-hemoglobin, can contribute to what is visually perceived as pigmentation. Furthermore, we present that measurement of its contribution to the skin color appearance can only be accomplished with DRS.},

abstract = {Variation in human skin and eye color is substantial and especially apparent in admixed populations, yet the underlying genetic architecture is poorly understood because most genome-wide studies are based on individuals of European ancestry. We study pigmentary variation in 699 individuals from Cape Verde, where extensive West African/European admixture has given rise to a broad range in trait values and genomic ancestry proportions. We develop and apply a new approach for measuring eye color, and identify two major loci (HERC2[OCA2] P = 2.3 × 10(-62), SLC24A5 P = 9.6 × 10(-9)) that account for both blue versus brown eye color and varying intensities of brown eye color. We identify four major loci (SLC24A5 P = 5.4 × 10(-27), TYR P = 1.1 × 10(-9), APBA2[OCA2] P = 1.5 × 10(-8), SLC45A2 P = 6 × 10(-9)) for skin color that together account for 35\% of the total variance, but the genetic component with the largest effect (\~{}44\%) is average genomic ancestry. Our results suggest that adjacent cis-acting regulatory loci for OCA2 explain the relationship between skin and eye color, and point to an underlying genetic architecture in which several genes of moderate effect act together with many genes of small effect to explain \~{}70\% of the estimated heritability.},

Through its use of an internal language model, DASHER efficiently converts bits received from the user into text, and has been shown to be a competitive alternative to existing text-entry methods in situations where an ordinary keyboard cannot be used. We propose that DASHER would be well-matched to the low bit-rate, noisy output obtained from brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), and discuss the issues surrounding the use of DASHER with BCI systems.},

@article{Gerard1994,
abstract = {The two main objectives of this study were to measure and analyse initial learning rates and electromyographic activity while using the Kinesis Ergonomic Computer Keyboard. Six professional typists learned how to use the Kinesis Ergonomic Computer Keyboard. After an initial learning period electromyographic activity in four muscles in the forearms was recorded while typing on the Kinesis Ergonomic Computer Keyboard. These data were then compared to electromyographic activity recorded while using a standard 101 key IBM PS/2 keyboard. The study showed that the Kinesis Ergonomic Computer Keyboard can be learned to 72\% of speed proficiency of the standard keyboard within 115 minutes. An accuracy of 97\% of the standard keyboard was reached within 65 minutes of use. After the initial learning period, subjects were able to relearn quickly to use the Kinesis Ergonomic Computer Keyboard after a break of several weeks. Electromyographic data analysis showed that the resting posture on the Kinesis Ergonomic Computer Keyboard required significantly less activity to maintain than the resting posture on the standard keyboard for the flexor carpi ulnaris and the flexor digitorum sublimis. Furthermore, the Kinesis Ergonomic Computer Keyboard reduced the muscular activity required for typing in the flexor carpi ulnaris, the extensor digitorum communis, and the flexor digitorum sublimis.},

abstract = {Melanocytes are phenotypically prominent but histologically inconspicuous skin cells. They are responsible for the pigmentation of skin and hair, and thereby contribute to the appearance of skin and provide protection from damage by ultraviolet radiation. Pigmentation mutants in various species are highly informative about basic genetic and developmental pathways, and provide important clues to the processes of photoprotection, cancer predisposition and even human evolution. Skin is the most common site of cancer in humans. Continued understanding of melanocyte contributions to skin biology will hopefully provide new opportunities for the prevention and treatment of skin diseases.},

abstract = {The author addresses the problem of parametric representation and
estimation of complex planar curves in 2-D surfaces in 3-D, and
nonplanar space curves in 3-D. Curves and surfaces can be defined either
parametrically or implicitly, with the latter representation used here.
A planar curve is the set of zeros of a smooth function of two variables
<e1>x</e1>-<e1>y</e1>, a surface is the set of zeros of a smooth
function of three variables <e1>x</e1>-<e1>y</e1>-<e1>z</e1>, and a
space curve is the intersection of two surfaces, which are the set of
zeros of two linearly independent smooth functions of three variables
<e1>x</e1>-<e1>y</e1>-<e1>z</e1> For example, the surface of a complex
object in 3-D can be represented as a subset of a single implicit
surface, with similar results for planar and space curves. It is shown
how this unified representation can be used for object recognition,
object position estimation, and segmentation of objects into meaningful
subobjects, that is, the detection of `interest regions' that are more
complex than high curvature regions and, hence, more useful as features
for object recognition},

@inproceedings{Sandnes2004,
abstract = {SMS (short messaging service) has become extremely popular in Europe. It allows users to send and receive short asynchronous messages at low cost. Text-messaging requires text-entry facilities, usually awkward and small 12-key phone keyboards labelled with the alphabet in the classic phone-layout. As devices are becoming smaller, for example wristwatches with Internet connectivity, there is less space for keys. Researchers have experimented with three-key text input devices and come up with designs allowing text to be entered with nearly as few as 4 keystrokes per characters on average. However, experiments have shown that these interfaces are hard to learn and thus slow to use in practice. In this paper we study four three-key mobile text-entry strategies with different characteristics, namely multiring, three-based binary and multitap. Three of the methods require from 1 to 7 keystrokes per character, and the third method always retrieves the required character with a constant of only three keystrokes per character for English text. Experiments are used to demonstrate that the techniques are easy to learn and pleasant to use. The techniques are cheap and simple to implement and therefore hold great potential for future text-enabled consumer electronics.},

abstract = {Human skin, especially the epidermis, contains several major solar ultraviolet-radiation- (UVR-) absorbing endogenous chromophores including DNA, urocanic acid, amino acids, melanins and their precursors and metabolites. The lack of solubility of melanins prevents their absorption spectra being defined by routine techniques. Indirect spectroscopic methods show that their spectral properties depend on the stimulus for melanogenesis. The photochemical consequences of UVR absorption by some epidermal chromophores are relatively well understood whereas we lack a detailed understanding of the consequent photobiological and clinical responses. Skin action spectroscopy is not a reliable way of relating a photobiological outcome to a specific chromophore but is important for UVR hazard assessment. Exogenous chromophores may be administered to the skin in combination with UVR exposure for therapeutic benefit, or as sunscreens for the prevention of sunburn and possibly skin cancer.},

@article{Sturm2009a,
abstract = {The genetic basis underlying normal variation in the pigmentary traits of skin, hair and eye colour has been the subject of intense research directed at understanding the diversity seen both between and within human populations. A combination of approaches have been used including comparative genomics of candidate genes and the identification of regions of the human genome under positive selection, together with genome-wide and specific allele association studies. Independent selection for different pigmentation gene sets has been found between Asian, European and African populations. Several genome-wide association studies for pigmentation have now been conducted and identified single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in known, TYR, TYRP1, OCA2, SLC45A2, SLC24A5, MC1R, ASIP, KITLG and previously unknown SLC24A4, IRF4, TPCN2, candidate genes. The contribution of SNP polymorphisms present in populations from South Asia have been tested and alleles found at TYR, SLC45A2 and SLC24A5 can largely account for differences between those of darkest and lightest skin reflectance using a simple additive model. Skin and hair colour associations in Europeans are found within a range of pigmentation gene alleles, whereas blue-brown eye colour can be explained by a single SNP proposed to regulate OCA2 expression. Functional testing of variant alleles has begun to connect phenotype correlations with biological differences. Variant MC1R alleles show direct correlations between the biochemical signalling properties of the encoded receptor and the red-hair fair skin pigmentation phenotype. Direct testing of a range of clonal melanocyte cultures derived from donor skin tissue characterized for three causal SNPs within SLC45A2, SLC24A5 and OCA2 has assessed their impact on melanin content and tyrosinase enzyme activity. From a culmination of genetic and functional studies, it is apparent that a number of genes impacting melanosome biogenesis or the melanin biosynthetic pathway are candidates to explain the diversity seen in human pigmentation.},
