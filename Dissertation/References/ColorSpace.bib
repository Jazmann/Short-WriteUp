abstract = {This work presents a new efficient method for fitting ellipses to
scattered data. Previous algorithms either fitted general conics or were
computationally expensive. By minimizing the algebraic distance subject
to the constraint 4ac-b<sup>2</sup>=1, the new method incorporates the
ellipticity constraint into the normalization factor. The proposed
method combines several advantages: It is ellipse-specific, so that even
bad data will always return an ellipse. It can be solved naturally by a
generalized eigensystem. It is extremely robust, efficient, and easy to
implement},

@article{Taubin1991,
abstract = {The author addresses the problem of parametric representation and
estimation of complex planar curves in 2-D surfaces in 3-D, and
nonplanar space curves in 3-D. Curves and surfaces can be defined either
parametrically or implicitly, with the latter representation used here.
A planar curve is the set of zeros of a smooth function of two variables
<e1>x</e1>-<e1>y</e1>, a surface is the set of zeros of a smooth
function of three variables <e1>x</e1>-<e1>y</e1>-<e1>z</e1>, and a
space curve is the intersection of two surfaces, which are the set of
zeros of two linearly independent smooth functions of three variables
<e1>x</e1>-<e1>y</e1>-<e1>z</e1> For example, the surface of a complex
object in 3-D can be represented as a subset of a single implicit
surface, with similar results for planar and space curves. It is shown
how this unified representation can be used for object recognition,
object position estimation, and segmentation of objects into meaningful
subobjects, that is, the detection of `interest regions' that are more
complex than high curvature regions and, hence, more useful as features
for object recognition},
